	%% The ordering is all over the place below,

	%% definitions and it will render the diagram differently.
	%% The order here gives the best visual appearance, with
	%% less crossing lines than if we drew and defined them
	%% in order.

    %% Student relationships
    Student --> UC2
    Student --> UC6
